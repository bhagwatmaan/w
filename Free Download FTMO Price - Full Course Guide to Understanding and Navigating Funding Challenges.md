For example, a $10,000 account might cost around $155, while a $200,000 account could be upwards of $1080. *These are rough estimates, and it's best to check the official FTMO website for the most accurate pricing.*

## Diving Deeper: FTMO Account Options and How to Choose

Beyond the initial challenge, understanding the different FTMO account options is crucial for long-term success. FTMO offers various account types, each with its own characteristics and advantages.

*   **FTMO Account Types:** FTMO generally offers account types based on leverage (e.g., Normal, Aggressive) and account balance sizes. Check the FTMO website for the most up-to-date information.
*   **Leverage:** Leverage amplifies both potential profits and losses. Choose a leverage level that aligns with your risk tolerance and trading strategy. Higher leverage can lead to quicker gains but also carries greater risk.
*   **Profit Split:** Once you become an FTMO Trader, you'll receive a profit split on the profits you generate. FTMO typically offers a generous profit split, often up to 80% or even 90% in some cases.
*   **Scaling Plan:** FTMO offers a scaling plan that allows you to increase your account balance based on consistent profitability. This is a significant benefit that rewards successful traders and provides opportunities for further growth.
*   **Choosing the Right Account:** Consider your trading style, risk tolerance, and capital requirements when choosing an FTMO account. A larger account allows for greater position sizing and potential profits, but also requires more capital and discipline.

The free downloadable guide includes examples of how to calculate potential earnings based on different account sizes and trading strategies.
