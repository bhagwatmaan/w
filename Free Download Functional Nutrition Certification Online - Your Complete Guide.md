## What is Functional Nutrition?

Functional nutrition isn't your average dietary advice. It goes beyond simply counting calories or recommending specific foods. It's a **systems-oriented approach** that considers the whole person â€“ their genetics, environment, lifestyle, and individual biochemistry. It aims to identify and address the root causes of health issues, rather than just treating the symptoms.

Here's a breakdown of key concepts in functional nutrition:

*   **Bio-individuality:** Recognizes that everyone is unique and has different nutritional needs. What works for one person might not work for another.
