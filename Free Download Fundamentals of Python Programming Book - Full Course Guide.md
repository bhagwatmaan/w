### 3. Control Flow: Making Decisions and Repeating Tasks

*   **Conditional Statements:** Using `if`, `elif`, and `else` statements to execute different blocks of code based on conditions.
*   **Loops:** Implementing `for` and `while` loops to repeat code execution, including loop control statements like `break` and `continue`.
*   **Nested Loops:** Creating loops within loops for more complex iterations and pattern generation.
*   **Boolean Logic:** Understanding boolean expressions and how they are used in conditional statements and loops.
*   **Truthiness and Falsiness:** Exploring the concept of truthiness and falsiness in Python, and how it affects conditional logic.

### 4. Data Structures: Organizing and Storing Data

*   **Lists:** Creating, accessing, modifying, and manipulating lists, including list slicing, concatenation, and common list methods.
*   **Tuples:** Understanding the immutability of tuples and when to use them over lists.
*   **Dictionaries:** Storing and retrieving data using key-value pairs, including dictionary operations like adding, updating, and deleting entries.
*   **Sets:** Working with sets for storing unique elements, including set operations like union, intersection, and difference.
*   **List Comprehensions:** Using list comprehensions to create new lists based on existing lists in a concise and efficient manner.

### 5. Functions: Building Reusable Code Blocks

*   **Defining Functions:** Creating reusable functions with parameters and return values.
*   **Function Arguments:** Understanding different types of function arguments, including positional arguments, keyword arguments, and default arguments.
*   **Variable Scope:** Exploring the concept of variable scope (local and global variables) and how it affects function behavior.
*   **Recursion:** Implementing recursive functions to solve problems by breaking them down into smaller, self-similar subproblems.
*   **Lambda Functions:** Creating anonymous functions using the `lambda` keyword for simple, one-line operations.
