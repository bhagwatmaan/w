## Understanding Key Mortgage Concepts

To truly master the material covered in the mortgage licensing exam, you need a firm grasp of key mortgage concepts. Here are a few examples:

*   **Loan-to-Value Ratio (LTV):** The LTV is the ratio of the loan amount to the appraised value or purchase price of the property, whichever is less.
*   **Debt-to-Income Ratio (DTI):** The DTI is the ratio of a borrower's total monthly debt payments to their gross monthly income.
*   **Annual Percentage Rate (APR):** The APR is the true cost of borrowing, including interest and other fees, expressed as a percentage.
*   **Private Mortgage Insurance (PMI):** PMI is insurance that protects the lender in case the borrower defaults on the loan. It is typically required when the LTV is greater than 80%.
*   **Escrow Account:** An escrow account is an account held by the lender to pay property taxes, homeowner's insurance, and other expenses associated with the property.
