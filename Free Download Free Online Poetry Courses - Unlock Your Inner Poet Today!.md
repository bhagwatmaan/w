Now, let's explore some popular poetic forms you might encounter in your free online poetry courses:

*   **Find Your Inspiration:** What inspires you? Is it nature, love, loss, social justice, or something else entirely? Let your passions guide your writing.
*   **Be Authentic:** Write from the heart. Don't try to imitate other poets or conform to expectations. Let your own unique experiences and perspectives shine through.
