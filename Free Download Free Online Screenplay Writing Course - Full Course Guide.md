## What Makes a Good Screenplay? The Foundations

Before diving into the specifics of our free course, let's cover the fundamentals of crafting a compelling screenplay:

*   **Concept:** A strong concept is the backbone of any successful film. It's the "what if" that hooks the audience and drives the narrative. Consider:
    *   **Originality:** Is your idea fresh and unique?
    *   **Marketability:** Does it have the potential to appeal to a broad audience?
    *   **Logline:** Can you condense your concept into a single, intriguing sentence?

*   **Story Structure:** A well-structured screenplay follows a clear and engaging narrative arc, typically based on the three-act structure:
    *   **Act I: Setup:** Introduce the protagonist, setting, and inciting incident.
    *   **Act II: Confrontation:** The protagonist faces obstacles and challenges, building tension and conflict.
    *   **Act III: Resolution:** The climax and resolution of the central conflict.

*   **Character Development:** Compelling characters are the heart of any great story.
    *   **Motivation:** What drives your characters? What are their goals and desires?
    *   **Flaws:** Characters with flaws are relatable and believable.
    *   **Arc:** How do your characters change and evolve throughout the story?

*   **Dialogue:** Dialogue should be realistic, engaging, and serve a purpose.
    *   **Subtext:** What is being said beneath the surface?
    *   **Voice:** Each character should have a distinct voice and personality.
    *   **Action:** Dialogue should propel the story forward and reveal character.

*   **Visual Storytelling:** Screenplays are visual mediums. Use descriptive language to paint a picture in the reader's mind.
    *   **Show, Don't Tell:** Use actions and visuals to convey information rather than relying on exposition.
    *   **Setting:** Create a vivid sense of place and atmosphere.
    *   **Pacing:** Control the rhythm and flow of the story through scene length and transitions.
