## Why Learn Functional Programming in Swift?

*   **Improved Code Quality:** Functional principles promote immutability, pure functions, and avoiding side effects, resulting in more robust code.
*   **Enhanced Testability:** Pure functions are much easier to test since their output depends only on their input.
*   **Better Concurrency:** Functional programming makes it easier to write concurrent code that avoids race conditions and other concurrency issues.
*   **Modern Swift Practices:** Functional programming is increasingly integrated into Swift's standard library and recommended best practices.

This free course typically covers:

*   ✔ Core Concepts: Immutability, pure functions, higher-order functions.
*   ✔ Swift's Functional Features: `map`, `filter`, `reduce`, and more.
*   ✔ Practical Examples: Applying functional techniques to real-world Swift projects.
*   ✔ Advanced Topics: Monads, functors (depending on the course content).
