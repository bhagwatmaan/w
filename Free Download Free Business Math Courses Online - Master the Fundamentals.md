## Deeper Dive: Understanding Key Business Math Concepts

Let's delve into some of the core concepts you'll likely encounter in a business math course:

*   **Percentage Change:** This measures the change in a value over time, expressed as a percentage. It's crucial for analyzing growth rates, market trends, and financial performance. The formula is: `((New Value - Old Value) / Old Value) * 100`. For instance, if sales increased from $100,000 to $120,000, the percentage change is `(($120,000 - $100,000) / $100,000) * 100 = 20%`.
*   **Profit Margin:** This is a key indicator of profitability, representing the percentage of revenue remaining after deducting the cost of goods sold (COGS). The formula is: `(Gross Profit / Revenue) * 100`. A higher profit margin indicates better efficiency and profitability.
*   **Break-Even Point:** This is the point at which total revenue equals total costs, meaning the business is neither making a profit nor incurring a loss. The formula (in units) is: `Fixed Costs / (Selling Price per Unit - Variable Cost per Unit)`. Understanding your break-even point is vital for pricing decisions and assessing the viability of a business venture.
*   **Return on Investment (ROI):** ROI measures the profitability of an investment relative to its cost. The formula is: `(Net Profit / Cost of Investment) * 100`. A higher ROI indicates a more profitable investment.
*   **Compound Interest:** Unlike simple interest, compound interest earns interest on both the principal and accumulated interest. The formula is: `A = P(1 + r/n)^(nt)`, where A is the future value, P is the principal, r is the interest rate, n is the number of times interest is compounded per year, and t is the number of years. Compound interest is a powerful tool for wealth accumulation.
